Ascend4nt's AutoIT Code License agreement:
While I provide this source code freely, if you do use the code in your projects, all I ask is that:

   1. If you provide source, keep the header as I have put it, OR, if you expand it, then at least acknowledge me as the original author, and any other authors I credit
   2. If the program is released, acknowledge me in your credits (it doesn't have to state which functions came from me, though  again if the source is provided - see #1)
   3. The source on it's own (as opposed to part of a project) can not be posted unless a link to the page(s) where the code were retrieved from is provided and a message stating that the latest updates will be available on the page(s) linked to.
   4. Pieces of the code can however be discussed on the threads where Ascend4nt has posted the code without worrying about further linking.
